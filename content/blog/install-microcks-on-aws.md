Whilst we recommend installing Microcks on Kubernetes for easy management and enhanced capabilities, it can also be deployed onto a regular Virtual Machine. This post details how you can setup Microcks onto an AWS EC2 instance if youâ€™re familiar with this environment and want a quick test drive. It takes something like 6â€“7 minutes to complete from end-to-end. Itâ€™s an illustration of official setup documentation.

This will give you a Microcks installation on an AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS :
* all-in-one install : Microcks, Keycloak and MongoDB on the same box,
* local storage mounted through Docker volumes,
* self-signed certificates for rapid testing.
