I am delighted to announce Microcks release 0.9.0 â€” the Open source Kubernetes native tool for API Mocking and Testing. This new version introduces a tremendous amount of enhancements and new features.

Big thanks to our growing community for all the work done, the raised issues and the collected feedback during the last 5 months to make it possible.

This release was the preparation to become more Enterprise-grade, and we are glad that Microcks is in production in more and more medium to large organisations. They use it to manage different use cases and sort out some business critical APIs life cycle management and development pains.

So we worked a lot on installation and managements features but also on some noticeable enhancements on existing core features.
Letâ€™s do a quick review on whatâ€™s new in this release!
