#### 1.5.2 on 02 Jun 2022

We are delighted to announce the `1.5.2` release of Microcks ‚ôªÔ∏è This is mainly an ‚ÄúEnhancement release‚Äù pushing further the [Microcks‚Äô Hub and Marketplace](https://microcks.io/blog/microcks-hub-announcement/) we introduced a few weeks ago.

In our vision, the Hub will hold a central place that will allow Microcks users to easily reuse **curated API Mocks & Test suites in a single click** - but also to share and publish their own. That‚Äôs why we absolutely wanted to have a nice **integration between the Hub and Microcks** - and that‚Äôs the purpose of this release.

#### 1.5.1 on 08 Apr 2022

We are proud to announce the `1.5.1` release of Microcks ‚ôªÔ∏è We considered it a minor release this time as it ‚Äújust‚Äù brought a new protocol binding and a lot of enhancements!

Once again this release is an illustration of how community-driven the roadmap is: **AMQP** and **Swagger v2** support as well as **more** **enhancements** came directly from user requests. So thanks a lot to those who helped push up a new release with significant features once again. Kudos to all of them üëè

#### 1.5.0 on 18 Jan 2022

We are excited to announce the `1.5.0` release of Microcks üöÄ Thanks to our supporters in the community that helped us push up a new release with significant features. This release puts again the focus on our vision of a unique tool with a consistent approach for **ALL kinds of APIs**.

The major addition if the support of [GraphQL](https://graphql.io/) thats makes Microcks the only tools able to simulate and realize contract-testing on REST, SOAP, gRPC, Events and GraphQL based APIs. Other enhancements are also worth to notice:

* A lighter developer experience with 50% reduction of footprint,
* A faster startup on Kubernetes,
* A lot of security updates and checks to ensure Microcks is not vulnerable to Log4Shell.
