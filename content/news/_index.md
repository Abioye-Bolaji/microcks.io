## Fresh Releases

### Microcks core

#### 1.5.0 on 18 Jan 2022

We are excited to announce the `1.5.0` release of Microcks ðŸš€ Thanks to our supporters in the community that helped us push up a new release with significant features. This release puts again the focus on our vision of a unique tool with a consistent approach for **ALL kinds of APIs**.

The major addition if the support of [GraphQL](https://graphql.io/) thats makes Microcks the only tools able to simulate and realize contract-testing on REST, SOAP, gRPC, Events and GraphQL based APIs. Other enhancements are also worth to notice:

* A lighter developer experience with 50% reduction of footprint,
* A faster startup on Kubernetes,
* A lot of security updates and checks to ensure Microcks is not vulnerable to Log4Shell.

We are thrilled to announce the `1.4.1` release that is another demonstration of the ability of Microcks to play on both sides with new Enterprise related features but also enhancement towards the Developer eXperience. Here are the highlighted changes of this release:
